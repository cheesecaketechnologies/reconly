Reconly 🕵️‍♀️ — Automated Bug Bounty Recon That Actually Saves You Time

Built with ❤️ by Cheesecake Technologies

⚡ What is Reconly?

Reconly is your ethical recon buddy. Whether you are a bug bounty hunter burning the midnight oil,
or a DevSecOps engineer stuck in endless triage loops, this tool runs your recon automatically — while you sleep,
while you eat, or while you scream into the void.

No bloated UIs. No snake oil. Just raw, efficient automation that works.

🔍 Key Features

- 🔗 Automated Subdomain Enumeration using trusted tools (`subfinder`, `amass`, `dnsx`, etc.)
- 🔑 GitHub Dorking + Secrets Detection (fast scans with regex and GitHub API)
- 🌐 Scope-Safe Recon Only — you define, it obeys
- 🎥 Optional PoC Video Generation (for reports or portfolios)
- 🧠 Smart CVSS Scoring + Custom Risk Labels
- 📬 Email Summary Reports so you can stay updated without staring at your terminal
- 💡 Modular — plug in your own tools or use it out of the box

🎯 Who’s It For?

- 🧑‍💻 Bug Bounty Hunters who want fast results
- 🛡️ DevSecOps Teams who need recon pipelines, not chaos
- 🧠 Learners who want a real-world setup for practice 
- 🔐 Startups & SMBs with no in-house security — set it, run it, sleep better
